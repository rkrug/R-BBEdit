This package for [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html) is trying to re-create regularly used shortcuts in [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/). It is work in progress, so please file issues and let me know if you have any additional actions ytou would like to have included.

I am no BBEdit wizard, but I will look into them.

The Apple Scripts  `Quick Paste to R.scpt`, `Paste to R.scpt`, `Source File in R - echo FALSE.scpt` and `18)R) Source File in R - echo TRUE.scpt` are from [Jonathan Marc Bearak](https://bearak.org/code/text/index.html) and I simply removed the Stata code.
